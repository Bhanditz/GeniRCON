#GeniRCON Client
* GeniRCON is based on **Source_RCON_PROTOCOL**.
* GeniRCON allows you to access server consolo through GeniRCON Client (not just running commands!)
* Servers using GeniRCON can also use RCON to connect.
#Acknowledgements
* ConsoleDaemon is based on CommandReader from **PocketMine-MP**.
* Terminal, TextFormat, MainLogger are copied from **PocketMine-MP**.
* Class GeniRCON is based on **Chris Churchwell**'s Rcon.
